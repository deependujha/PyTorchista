# Topics to learn 🧑‍🎓🧑‍💻

> Here are some key topics that you can learn in order to become proficient in using PyTorch:

- **Tensors** and operations: PyTorch is built on top of tensors, which are multi-dimensional arrays. You should learn about the various tensor operations that PyTorch supports, such as matrix multiplication, addition, and slicing.

---
- **Autograd**: PyTorch's automatic differentiation engine, called Autograd, allows you to compute gradients automatically. You should learn how to use Autograd to compute gradients for your models.

---
- **Neural** networks: PyTorch makes it easy to define and train neural networks. You should learn how to use PyTorch's nn module to define and train neural networks.

---
- **Convolutional** Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs are commonly used in computer vision tasks such as image classification and object detection. You should learn how to use PyTorch to define and train CNNs.

---
- **Recurrent** Neural Networks (RNNs): RNNs are used for sequential data such as time series data and natural language processing. You should learn how to use PyTorch to define and train RNNs.

---
- **Transfer** learning: Transfer learning is a technique where a pre-trained neural network is used as a starting point for a new model. You should learn how to use pre-trained models in PyTorch and fine-tune them for your specific tasks.

---
- **Optimization** techniques: PyTorch provides various optimization techniques for training models, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and Adagrad. You should learn about these optimization techniques and how to use them in PyTorch.

---
- **Data** loading and preprocessing: PyTorch provides tools for loading and preprocessing data, such as DataLoader and transforms. You should learn how to use these tools to efficiently load and preprocess your data.

---
- **GPU** acceleration: PyTorch can be accelerated using GPUs, which can significantly speed up training. You should learn how to use PyTorch with GPUs to train your models faster.

---
- **Model** deployment: Once you have trained your PyTorch model, you will need to deploy it for use in production. You should learn how to deploy PyTorch models using frameworks such as Flask or Django.

These topics should provide a strong foundation in using PyTorch for machine learning and deep learning tasks.
